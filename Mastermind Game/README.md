This is a digital version of the classic Mastermind game, implemented in Python. The player's goal is to guess the correct combination of colors within a limited number of attempts.

## Features

- Multiple difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, with varying numbers of colors and code lengths.
- Interactive user input and feedback for each guess.
- Randomly generated secret code for each game.
- Informative messages about correct color and position, and correct color only.
- User-friendly interface with clear instructions.

## How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the repository directory in your terminal.
3. Run the script using a Python interpreter: `python mastermind_game.py`.
4. Choose a difficulty level by entering the corresponding number (1, 2, or 3).
