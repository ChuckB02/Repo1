# Code-to-Narrative Visualization Tool

Welcome to the Code-to-Narrative Visualization Tool! This Python script converts code snippets into visual narratives, providing a unique way to understand code structures and functionalities.

## How to Use

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download or clone this repository.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the repository's directory.
4. Modify the `example_codes` list in the script with your own code snippets for testing.
5. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```shell
   python code_to_narrative.py
   ```
1.Observe the generated visualizations and narrative descriptions for each function.

## Features

- Visualizes code structures as directed graphs using NetworkX.
- Generates narrative descriptions of functions based on their code content.
- Provides example code snippets for testing and learning.

## Customization

- Add your own example code snippets to the example_codes list for testing.
- Customize the parse_code, visualize_narrative, and generate_narrative functions to match your requirements.

## Limitations

- This script provides a simplified example of code-to-narrative visualization.
- It's intended to serve as a starting point for a more advanced and feature-rich tool.

##Further Enhancements

To create a more comprehensive tool, consider the following enhancements:

- Integrating more advanced code analysis techniques for accurate function detection.
- Exploring advanced graph visualization libraries for more interactive and detailed visualizations.
- Incorporating NLP techniques to generate richer and more meaningful narrative descriptions.
