# Guessing Game GUI
 In this game a random number is generated in range 1 to 1000 (so to make game tough) and player has only 10 number of attempts to guess correct number. This algorithm automatically tells the player that if he/she is going in right direction or not.

## Modules used

- random

## How it works

- A random number is generated is generated by the random module using randint() function in range 1 to 1000.
- Player can input his guessed number at most 10 times.
- This algorithm tells the user if his entered number is greater or less than the destination number and each time alarm the player that this many attempts are left for his to reach the destination number otherwise he will lose the game.
- If player wins it shows that in how in many attempts he/she able to reach the correct number.
