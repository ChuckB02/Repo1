# Affine Transformation
This python script will allow us to change perspective of an image using Affine transformation.

## Setup Instructions
### Install python3
sudo apt-get install python3
### Install pip (package installer for python)
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
### Install Numpy library with pip
pip3 install numpy
### Install OpenCV library with pip

## Details/Output
User selects an input image and the script changes its perspective using Affine transformation.  
In Affine transformation, parallel lines still stay parallel after transformation.
(**Note** The positions of any 3 points (should not be collinear) on the original image and the positions where they would be present after the transformation should be specified in the code.
