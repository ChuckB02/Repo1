# Text-to-Speech Conversion

This Python program converts text input into speech using the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library and plays the generated audio using the `playsound` library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `gTTS` library (`pip install gTTS`)
- `playsound` library (`pip install playsound`)

## Usage

1. Install the required libraries by running the following commands:
pip install gTTS
pip install playsound

Copy

2. Run the `text_to_speech.py` script:
```
python text_to_speech.py
Enter the desired text when prompted.

The program will convert the entered text to speech and save it as an MP3 file named output.mp3.

The generated speech will be played automatically using the default audio player on your system.

Customization
You can modify the code to change the language or adjust the speech synthesis options by referring to the gTTS documentation.

To change the output filename, modify the filename variable in the code.

Feel free to incorporate the text-to-speech functionality into your own projects by importing the text_to_speech function.
