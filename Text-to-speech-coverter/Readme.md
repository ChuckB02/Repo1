# Text-to-Speech Conversion

This Python program converts text input into speech using the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library and plays the generated audio using the `playsound` library.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- See `requirements.txt` for the required libraries and versions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:https://github.com/emranpy/Amazing-Python-Scripts.git
2. Navigate to the project directory: cd Text-to-speech-converter
3. Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run the `text_to_speech.py` script:

2. Enter the desired text when prompted.

3. The program will convert the entered text to speech and save it as an MP3 file named `output.mp3`.

4. The generated speech will be played automatically using the default audio player on your system.

## Customization

- You can modify the code to change the language or adjust the speech synthesis options by referring to the `gTTS` documentation.

- To change the output filename, modify the `filename` variable in the code.

- Feel free to incorporate the text-to-speech functionality into your own projects by importing the `text_to_speech` function.
