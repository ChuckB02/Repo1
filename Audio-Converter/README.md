# Audio Converter
A simple python script that converts a given video file into its equivalent audio file **without tampering** with the quality of the audio present in the video.  
A thing to note is keeping the target video file in the same folder as this script.  
### Requirements.
* **MoviePy**  
It is a python library used for video editing, cutting, concatenation, processing and more.  
Run the following command to install the module.  
```
pip install moviepy
```
### PS.
The code is good enough to handle bad input given by the user, such as video files that aren't present in the directory as the script or faulty inputs.  
Hope you like it!
