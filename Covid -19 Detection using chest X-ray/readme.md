first train the data set and save the model in the model_adv.h5,  so that we can use that file for to build a complete sytsem.

After saving  model_adv.h5 you can see a .py file were whole code runs, for the system. After running the script. You can just import a chest X-ray in the system and check wether the the person is suffering fron the covid-19 or not.
