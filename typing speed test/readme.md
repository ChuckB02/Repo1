# Package/Script Name
Typing Speed Test

## Setup instructions

before running the scipt,
please run,
    `pip install pygame`

## Detailed explanation of script, if needed
Typing is all about muscle memory, so the only way to improve is to practice typing regularly. 

You should always start typing by placing your fingers on the home row. There are the small bumps on the F and J key, which indicate the initial position of your index fingers. It helps you find this starting position on the keyboard without looking at it. Once you start with this position, your fingers have the full range of motion and a proper distance to all keys. It is the most optimal hands placement during typing.

* The WPM stands for words per minute, and it is a measure of typing speed, commonly used in the recruitment process and typing speed tests.
