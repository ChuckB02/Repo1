## Objectives

The main objectives of this project are:

- To gain a better understanding of control theory
- To see the implementation of PID-Control in real life
- To successfully balance the pole on the moving cart.

## Usage

The script uses gym module. To install please type the following command in your bash.

```bash
pip install requirements.txt
```
After which, once you have navigated to the directory, you can simply run the script using
